**JK Flip-Flop**

JK flip-flop is the modified version of SR flip-flop. It operates with only positive clock transitions or negative clock transitions. The circuit diagram of JK flip-flop is shown in the following figure.

This circuit has two inputs J & K and two outputs Qtt & Qtt’. The operation of JK flip-flop is similar to SR flip-flop. Here, we considered the inputs of SR flip-flop as S = J Qtt’ and R = KQtt in order to utilize the modified SR flip-flop for 4 combinations of inputs. The following table shows the state table of JK flip-flop.

Here, Qtt & Qt+1t+1 are present state & next state respectively. So, JK flip-flop can be used for one of these four functions such as Hold, Reset, Set & Complement of present state based on the input conditions, when positive transition of clock signal is applied. The following table shows the characteristic table of JK flip-flop. Present Inputs Present State Next State

By using three variable K-Map, we can get the simplified expression for next state, Qt+1t+1. Three variable K-Map for next state, Qt+1t+1 is shown in the following figure.

The maximum possible groupings of adjacent ones are already shown in the figure. Therefore, the simplified expression for next state Qt+1t+1 is Q(t+1)=JQ(t)′+K′Q(t)Q(t+1)=JQ(t)′+K′Q(t)

**Procedure**

1.Use module projname(input,output) to start the Verilog programming. 2.Assign inputs and outputs using the word input and output respectively. 3.Use defined keywords like wire,assign and required logic gates to represent the boolean expression. 4.Use each output to represent one for difference and the other for borrow. 5.End the verilog program using keyword endmodule

/* write all the steps invloved */

**PROGRAM**

    module program7(j,k,clk,q,qbar);
    input j,k,clk;
    output reg q,qbar;
    initial 
    begin
    q=1'b0;
    q=1'b1;
    end 

    always @(posedge clk)
    begin 
    q<=(j&~q)|(~k&q);
    qbar<=~q;
    end
    endmodule
